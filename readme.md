# Project Nutshell
## A nice clean web app that will help explain HackClub to non-hackers
### Here's the main idea:
Will hopefully be a tool in the toolbox that will help club leaders explain to non-hackers **what really is a hackclub?**
I envison a tree upon which there will be branches containing **nuts**, each **nut** will be snapshot of a club.
The trunk of the tree will house all of hackclub's core values (Like social coding)

### Some technical hoo-ha:
Will be two major releases:

First release:
Design and Branding:
- Tree design
- branch design
- nutshell art
Generative Tree functionality 
- adding new branches (maybe focus each branch on a country then state, city?)
- Adding nutshells to each branch

Second release:
Nutshell functionality:
- Uploading images, documents and videos to it
- Some kind of passkey system to access it
- Database to store and reference everything
- Create a refined **nutshell editor** so that clubs can put pictures/documents/memories of clubs
